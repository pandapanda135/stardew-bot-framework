This is what is needed to contribute, this is still being worked on however everything here is still true.

- This framework (and all mods that use it) need [martiandweller's](https://github.com/martiandweller) [fork of SMAPI](https://github.com/martiandweller/SMAPI/tree/ExposeInputOverride?tab=readme-ov-file) to control the character. The only part of this framework that utilizes this is the character controller, so if you are not using that you can use vanilla SMAPI however that has not been tested.
